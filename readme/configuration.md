# Configuration

The card has a lot of configuration options to change it to your needs. All options can be added in the configuration of the card, eg:

```yaml
type: custom:fr24-card
entity: sensor.fr24_aircraft
lang: nl
sort: track
```

The following configuration options are available:

| Option             | Type      | Default                                                                        | Accepted                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
